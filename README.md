<h1>About</h1>
I wanted a simple application to help with updating addons for Project Epoch so I used claude to create this.

It currently allows updating of addons from both github and gitlab. 
Provides a few addons for 3.3.5a as one-click installs.

<h1>Known Issues</h1>

- If your WoW directory is in Program Files then you will need to run this as admin.

Please create a github issue for any problems you find and I'll take a look at some point.
